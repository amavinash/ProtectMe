 ProtectMe is your go-to personal safety app. It is ideal for bullying, harassment and emergency situations when you may be low on time to call for help. Its design is simplistic and efficient – all you need to do is click thrice. And then, an alert message is broadcast to a predefined list of contacts with your current location. ProtectMe is a help indicator which enables your safety with only three clicks, so let it PROTECT YOU!

Features:
•	Safety that is just few clicks away
•	Provides options for different scenarios:
Scenario 1: Potential danger – Use the blue button to notify people when you sense trouble
Scenario 2: Emergency – Use the red button in case of emergency
•	Clear visual icons reduce confusion in times of need
•	Customized alerts – Customize the message to be broadcast
•	Shares your current location along with the alert message
•	Customized contact list – Select up to 5 numbers from your contact list that need to be notified
•	Process estimated to be at least 5 seconds faster than a normal text message and 15 seconds faster than a call
•	Designed to be used under circumstances such as pity theft (cell phone, jewelry or wallet robbery), instance of someone following or walking towards you with intent to attack, bullying in college or school, instances of threat in train or bus.
•	Best for use in vulnerable locations such as dark lanes, lonely roads, early morning or late night hours, isolated train stations or bus stops

Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS location services while the app runs in the background may reduce the battery life of your phone.
